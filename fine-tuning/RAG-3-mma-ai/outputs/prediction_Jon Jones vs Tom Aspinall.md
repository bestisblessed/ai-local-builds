- **Wins:** 12
- **Losses:** 2
- **Height:** 6'5"
- **Birth Date:** April 11, 1993

**Recent Performance:**
Tom Aspinall has rapidly ascended the heavyweight ranks with a string of impressive performances. He is known for his striking power and grappling ability, often finishing fights quickly. His last fight was on July 22, 2023, against Sergei Pavlovich, where he suffered a TKO loss in the first round due to a knee injury.

**Strengths:**

- **Grappling:** He has a solid grappling background, which allows him to control opponents on the ground.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Inexperience:** While he has shown great potential, Aspinall lacks the extensive experience that Jones possesses, particularly in high-stakes fights.
- **Injury Concerns:** His recent injury in the fight against Pavlovich raises questions about his durability and ability to withstand pressure in a fight.

### Prediction

**Winner:** Jon Jones

**Method of Victory:** Submission

**Round:** 3

**Rationale:**
1. **Experience vs. Inexperience:** Jon Jones has faced elite competition throughout his career, while Aspinall is still relatively new to the top tier of the heavyweight division. This experience will likely give Jones an edge in a high-pressure environment.
   
2. **Fight IQ and Adaptability:** Jones's ability to adjust his strategy mid-fight is unparalleled. He can exploit Aspinall's weaknesses, particularly if the fight goes into deeper rounds where Jones's conditioning and experience will play a significant role.

3. **Grappling Advantage:** While Aspinall has grappling skills, Jones's wrestling and submission game are elite. If the fight goes to the ground, Jones is likely to find openings for submissions, especially as Aspinall tires.

4. **Durability and Conditioning:** Jones has shown the ability to endure and thrive in later rounds, while Aspinall's recent injury and the nature of heavyweights suggest that he may not be able to maintain his pace against a fighter of Jones's caliber.

In conclusion, while Tom Aspinall is a talented fighter with a bright future, Jon Jones's experience, fight IQ, and grappling prowess make him the likely winner in this matchup, with a submission victory in the third round.
